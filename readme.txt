== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do you offer a Premium plugin? =

Yes, we do have a [Schema Premium](https://schema.press/downloads/schema-premium/) plugin that is packed with [features](https://schema.press/features/) and [supports more schema.org types](https://schema.press/docs-premium/supported-types/).

See [Schema Free vs Schema Premium](https://schema.press/vs/).

= The plugin isn't working or have a bug? =

Post detailed information about the issue in the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/schema) and we will work to fix it.

= Is there any Documentation for this plugin? =

Indeed, detailed information about the plugin can be found on the [documentation section](https://schema.press/docs/) on our website.

= Are you going to support new schema.org types in the future? =

Nope! The Schema plugin is meant to add markup to a basic WordPress installation, including those types (mostly Article, BlogPosting) which needs to be supported on a fresh install. 

Other schema.org types shall be added via [Plugin Extensions](https://schema.press/downloads/), or a custom code.

= Is there a way to add a new schema.org type? =

Yes we do. We have a premium schema.org plugin called [Schema Premium](https://schema.press/downloads/schema-premium/).

= Is there a way to add a new schema.org type? =

Luckily… Yes! Schema plugin has a filter which can be used to [add support for new schema.org types](https://schema.press/docs/adding-support-new-schema-org-types/).

= Knowledge Graph is not showing? =

The plugin meant to validate markup in Google Structured Data Testing Tool, we don’t have control over the actual display of Knowledge Graph.

= I see an error in Google Structure Data Testing Tool =

This could be for one -or more- of the following reasons:

 * Image error: This is a missing WordPress Featured image, try to upload a Featured image.
 * Logo error: This is a missing Publisher logo, it can be set in the plugin settings page, Schema > Settings > General > Publisher Logo.

P.S. You may encounter errors for sites hosted locally, for accessibility reasons.

= Compatible with Yoast SEO? =

Yes, Schema plugin will detect Yoast SEO plugin and override its output on the front page of your site, this means all Knowledge Graph and Site Search output will be generated by Schema. However, the plugin settings gives you control over which plugin should output Knowledge Graph markup, Search Results, and Breadcrumbs.

= Compatible with AMP plugin? =

Yes, Schema plugin will detect AMP plugin and output a more complete and valid schema.org markup.
